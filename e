# The program e is a command line utility that extracts lots of
# different archives. It is very simple and can be extended very easily.
#
# It is inspired by how firewall use their rulesets, and works like this:
# 
# * For each file that has to be extracted, the rules are matched one after the other.
# * When a rule matches (either by the filetype or filename), the command is executed.
# * If the command does not return an error code  the extraction is considered successful, otherwise the next rules are matched.
#
# It currently has rules for zip, rar, 7zip, gzip, bzip2, rpm, cab, arj, ace, ppmd, lzo, tar.bz2, tar.gz, ...

# Each rule consists of 3 parts:
#
# 1. type of the match: currently either :name or :type. If you use :name, then the regular expression
# is matched against the filename. If you use :type, the regular expression is matched against the
# output of the "file" command. Usually :type is a better choice because you are independent from the
# actual filename, but for file types that cannot be detected use :name.
#
# 2. The regular expression is used in a match. If the regular expression matches, the command
# (3rd parameter of the rule) is executed.
#
# 3. The command to execute. %FILE% is replaced by the filename (with apostrophe).
#
# On extraction, each of the rules are matched one after the other. The command of 
# the first rule that matches is executed. If the executed command does not return an
# error code, extraction was successful. If the command could not be executed (e.g. if do not
# have unrar but only rar) or returns with an error code, the next rules are matched until
# either no rule is available any more, or extraction was successful.
